      About
    </h1>
    <p>
      Experienced in building sleek, and resilient services, I've worked with analysts and designers to create solutions that meet user needs.
      I'm passionate about working across the stack, from building ETL pipelines with data driven dashboards, to maintaining internal modules and libraries.
      Working on new projects I've laid out plans, timelines, and created MVPs following iterative development. Delivering results, and continuing to enhance.
      Deploying with Kubernetes, and various cloud providers I've built internal tools, infastrcuture as code, and pipelines to support teams.
      More than comfortable with the latest in the web, frameworks, SSR, and orms.
      Outside of that, I love mountain biking, running, and being out in nature. I often give talks, and enjoy being part of the local tech scene.
